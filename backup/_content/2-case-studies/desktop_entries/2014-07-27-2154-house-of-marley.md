    headerCaption: WHAT WOULD BOB DO?
    caption: The Marley family wanted to craft an entire brand around their patriarch. Given his mark on society, this was a pretty gargantuan task. We started by creating the internal mantra “What would Bob do?”, using this as a driving force to develop the brand.

    headerCaption: LOGO
    caption: The logo was inspired by a crown, as there is deep significance of the “king” in Rastafarian culture. We also designed this to feel like a continuous line, representing ongoing-motion and embrace.

    headerCaption: PACKAGING
    caption: It was imperative all packaging be 100% sustainable and organic – we even experimented with potato packaging. We ended up with a minimalist molded-paper design that felt raw and “from the Earth”.
