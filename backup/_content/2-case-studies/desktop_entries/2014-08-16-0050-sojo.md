    headerCaption: THE PROJECT
    caption: A hospitality company dealing with luxury hotel properties came to us because they were looking to build a mobile app. The app aimed to connect frequent travelers who are hotel “experts” who are accustomed to 5-start travel, such as vacationers, business travelers, and corporate event planners.

    headerCaption: IDENTITY
    caption: 'The client wanted the app to feel like a “get away”, so we used hotel pools and idyllic weather as inspiration. '

    headerCaption: NAMING
    caption: 'Using our unique methodology for naming, where we “bucket” themes and interweave to various directions, we came up with the name Sojo to represent the idea of a “Social Journey”, and nod toward the word “sojourn”. '

    headerCaption: LOGO DESIGN
    caption: 'For the logo, they wanted to reference the hotel experience with discovery, so we bridged a Do Not Disturb door hanger with a map-location balloon per their direction. '

    headerCaption: WIREFRAMES
    caption: We whiteboarded with the team, worked through sketches, and landed on the user experience and flow of the app within wireframes, all prior to applying visual design.

    headerCaption: FINAL DESIGNS
    caption: For the initial roll-out, it was important to be able to find “Travel Buddies” easily through your current social networks, and to reach out to a hotel directly from the app. Additionally, a key thing was feeling like you really know the hotel you’re looking to book, so we made it easy to view details and hi-res images.
