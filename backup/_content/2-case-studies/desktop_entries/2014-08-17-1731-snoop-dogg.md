    headerCaption: 'LOGO & PACKAGING'
    caption: The logo was built from a silhouette of Snoop “Crip walking” – he grew up in gang culture and it was important to recognize this, yet in a positive light. For shoeboxes, the logo popped out as a stencil, which was a nod to graffiti culture, and we used a blue Snoop bandana as the shoe wraps.

    headerCaption: RETAIL
    caption: To incorporate low riders, we created actual car plaques as in-store displays – plaques are proudly displayed in the rear window of low rider owners who belong to specific car clubs. We went so far as to have these sand-casted and painted with actual car paint.
