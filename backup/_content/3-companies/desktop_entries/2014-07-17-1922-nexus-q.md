<p>The Nexus Q was Google's first consumer home product, which they wanted to unveil at San Francisco's annual I/O Developer's Conference with a kick ass video. The exterior of the product was clean, smooth, and just plain sexy, so we wanted to juxtapose that with the intricate and extensive internal engineering required to make the damned thing work. We did this by â€œexploding" out the device in layers in the video, showcasing the intricacies while championing the beauty of the actual consumer product.</p>
