<p>Avaya wanted an internal video emphasizing the “artisan approach” the company takes toward communications products – they wanted their employees to feel like their work at the company has an element of craftsmanship and care. This video was created entirely from still shots, separated out and then animated in 3D to create the parallax effect, which gave the video unique dimension and movement.</p>
