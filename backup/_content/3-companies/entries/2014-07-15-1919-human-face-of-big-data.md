<p>We designed the user experience for a cross-platform mobile app showcasing the concept of big data by utilizing people as “human sensors” with their mobile phones. The goal was to “measure the planet” in a fun and engaging way by asking people questions and have them complete simple tasks inside the app. Over 4 million interactive survey questions were answered within the first few days of the app going live.</p>
