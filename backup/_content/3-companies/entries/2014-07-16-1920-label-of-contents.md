<p>We designed and distributed an apparel line, where each “Chapter” represented a different style and screen printed theme. The first line was celebrating New York City, so we shot pictures of manholes around the city and printed them around the sides of shirts, in pop-art colors. For the launch campaign, we created "book safes" and rolled a t-shirt into each, using a bookmark-style hang tag as a marker for people to open the books and discover the t-shirt inside.</p>
