<p>Snoop wanted to create a brand around his new footwear line with Pony, called Doggy Biscuitz. Everything about the brand had to reflect him as an individual: His Long Beach lifestyle, West Coast hip-hop, his love for sports, and his passion for low rider culture. We worked to incorporate this into each piece of collateral, from shoe boxes to in-store displays.</p>
