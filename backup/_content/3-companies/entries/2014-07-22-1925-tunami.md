<p>Sound Design company Altec Lansing had developed their first Sound Bar for consumers, and needed a product name and logo for the brand extension. They wanted to showcase the “big sound” that was coming out of such a minimal, sleek design. We created the name and bridged it into a logo design that echoed ideas of a sound wave and a surf wave.</p>
