# On Hooks
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Hooks are a powerful tool that allows add-ons to hook into system events. 
# This enables add-ons to work behind the scenes at just the right times. There 
# is, however, a trade-off. Each hook takes a little bit of time to run. It's 
# not *a lot* of time, but enable enough of them and you'll start to notice a 
# slight delay.
#
# We want to add in many hooks for add-on developers to possibly use, but we 
# didn't want to hinder the performance for most just to benefit a few. Thus,
# we've added this configuration file. You can turn on only the hooks that you 
# absolutely need. If an add-on needs to use a hook, it should tell you so in 
# its documentation, generally as part of the `install` section.
#
# Remember, only turn on what's needed.
# Happy (selective) hook-enabling. :)
